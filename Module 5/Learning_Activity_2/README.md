# Learning Activity 2: Try-Except

This learning activity requires you to rework exercises 1 to 5 in Learning Activity 1 and use the try-except block to
handle errors or erroneous inputs. You can take help from the reworked code of exercise 6 in Learning Activity 1 as
shown below.

At the end, add comments to the code to explain the purpose of different statements. Submit your code/output screenshots
to the Module 5 Learning Activity 2 discussion forum.
