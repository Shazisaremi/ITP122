# Learning Activity 1: Type, Run and Comment Code

This learning activity requires you to:

Write the program or type the given code and run the code for the given problem Test the output obtained. Add comments
to the code to explain the purpose of different statements. Comments are an important programming feature, and they help
programmers to keep track of code sections in long code exercises. Programmers can also use the code of their team
members and vice versa.

Complete the 5 exercises with comments to the code, then number your code/output screenshots with the corresponding
exercise number and submit them in the Module 5 Learning Activity 1 discussion forum.

## Exercise 1: Write a Python program to compute the total cost after discount.

A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than $1000. Ask user to input the quantity.
