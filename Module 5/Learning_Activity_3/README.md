# Learning Activity 3: Challenge Yourself

This learning activity requires you to read the problem and design and implement the solution using Python. Add comments
to the code to explain the purpose of different statements. Submit your code/output screenshots to the Module 5 Learning
Activity 3 discussion forum.

## Exercise 1 :
Write a program in Python to read your student ID from the keyboard (as user input value). Extract the numeric and add
