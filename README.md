Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level
built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
Pythonâ€™s simple, easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
