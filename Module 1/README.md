    * ### Installing Python IDLE on Windows PC
      This video shows you what you need to do to install Python in Windows as Windows does not come with an already
      installed version of Python. Follow the instructions even though the version you use may be different. In
      addition, you will also learn how to check which version of Python is installed and how to use it with the help of
      Terminal — an application also available on Windows that enables you to run commands and execute scripts.
