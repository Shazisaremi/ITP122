# Learning Activity 2: Challenge Yourself!

This learning activity requires you to read the problem, and design and implement the solution using Python. Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of different statements. Submit your code/output screenshots to the discussion forum.

## Exercise 1: Dictionaries

Create a dictionary of the following lists:

my_list1=[ 1, 2, 3]

my_list2=[‘a’, ‘b’]

- 1 Create a dictionary called my_dictionary_of_lists and use the keys and values mentioned above.
- 2 Append 4 into key ‘my_list1’ such that it’s values are [1,2,3,4].


## Exercise 2: Modifying Dictionaries

Create a student dictionary. Fill it with three students’ names and their ID numbers.

Choose your variables and dictionary keys wisely so that they can be understood from their names.

- 1 Output the second student’s name.
- 2 Print the second student’s ID number.
- 3 Add a new student element in it.
- 4 Check if a student with ID=123 exists in the dictionary you’ve created.
